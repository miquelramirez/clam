Description: CLAM audio annotation tool
 The CLAM Annotator is a tool to visualize, check and modify music
 information extracted from audio: low level features, note
 segmentation, chords, structure... The tool is intended to be useful for
 the music information retrieval research whenever you need to:
  * Supervise and correct the results of automated audio feature
  extraction algorithms.
  * Generate manually edited annotations of audio as training examples or
  ground truth for those algorithms.
 .
 The application adapts to user defined description schemes, auralizes
 annotations and provides import and export support for wavesurfer formats.
 It also has support for collaborative and distributed annotation campaigns.
