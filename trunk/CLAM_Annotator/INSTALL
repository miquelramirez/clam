This file explains how to compile and install the CLAM applications 
from the source tarballs.

 1. Compile CLAM libraries and their dependencies
 
 Please refer to the INSTALL file in the CLAM (library) tarball.

 2. (Provisional step) Compile the CLAM-vmqt module

	From the CLAM-vmqt module root type
    $ scons clam_prefix=/usr/local clam_sconstools=/CLAM-sources/scons/sconstools

 3. Compile the CLAM Music Annotator.

    From the CLAM-Annotator source root type:
	$ scons clam_prefix=/usr/local clam_sconstools=/CLAM-sources/scons/sconstools install_prefix=/usr/local clam_vmqt4_path=/path/to/vmqt/lib

 For further building options do :

	$ scons --help

 Notice that if you are using a non-standard clam_prefix, you might 
 need to make the LD_LIBRARY_PATH to point to the CLAM lib directory.

 On windows platform you could also build a package by typing on a shell:
    $ scons package
