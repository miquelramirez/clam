HOW TO COMPILE THE ANNOTATOR

ON GNU/LINUX

Simply:

> make depend
> make CONFIG=debug  (or release)

ON MS WINDOWS

You should expect some problems because of the integration between the qt and CLAM build systems. But it should work if you follow this steps:

- run cmd
- go to your CLAM_Annotator\build directory and do:

	> nmake /f Makefile.images.rules
	> make depend
- Open the generated project from Visual.net
- Compile (in this first run you will get a bunch of errors because of uic and moc files not found, don't worry)
- In your visual project add two folders: uic and moc. Add to these folders all the files you will find in CLAM_Annotator/build/uic and /moc directories.
- You will probably also have to add an include path to your Visual project (/src)
- Compile again and now it should work.
- If you ever need to add files to your visual project, we recommend that you delete all the Annotator.* files in the build directory and start the process all over again.
