Description: CLAM prototyping tool
 The CLAM Network Editor is a tool for editing CLAM processing networks.
 Those processing networks can become the processing core of an audio

 or by using the CLAM Prototyper to link the network to a Qt Designer
 interface.
 .
 This packages provides both the Network Editor and the Prototyper
 in several flawours (jack and alsa).
 It also provides a plugin for Qt Designer which adds widgets
