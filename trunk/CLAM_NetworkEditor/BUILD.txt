NetworkEditor currently it needs the oscpack library copied at the same dir level as CLAM/. This is just provisional till we provide a standard installer for oscpack.

These are the steps needed to compile and run NetworkEditor:

1) go into CLAM/draft/OSCCLAM/oscpack-lib
   or you can download oscpack-lib from the clam web.
   and compile it with 'make'. this will create a new 'owcpack' dir.
2) move this 'oscpack' dir at the same dir-level as CLAM/
3) export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/clam-sandoxes/oscpack/lib/
4) compile NetworkEditor in the clam way:
   - go to CLAM_NetworkEditor/build dir
   - modify the 'clam-location.cfg' so it points to the CLAM path
   - 'make depend'    [*]
   - 'make CONFIG=release'
5) run ./NetworkEditor

[*] 'make depend' requires having the CLAM 'srcdeps' program compiled. 
To do so just go to CLAM/build/srcdeps and do 'make'
