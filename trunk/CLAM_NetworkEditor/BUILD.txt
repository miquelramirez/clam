Build instructions for GNU/Linux
--------------------------------

NetworkEditor currently it needs the oscpack library copied at the same dir level as CLAM/. This is just provisional till we provide a standard installer for oscpack.

These are the steps needed to compile and run NetworkEditor:
1) make sure that liboscpack is installed in your system.
   you can download the tarball from the CLAM web (download)
   Note that if you want to change the prefix (default is /usr)
   where liboscpack will be installed you need to edit the Makefile
2) compile NetworkEditor in the clam way:
   - go to CLAM_NetworkEditor/build dir
   - modify the 'clam-location.cfg' so it points to the CLAM path
   - 'make depend'    [*]
   - 'make CONFIG=release'
3) run ./NetworkEditor

[*] 'make depend' requires having the CLAM 'srcdeps' program compiled. 
To do so just go to CLAM/build/srcdeps and do 'make'
