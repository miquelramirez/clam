-------------------------------------------

1. Make shure that you have unpacked both CLAM and CLAM_NetworkEditor tarballs 
   in the same directory.

2. Configure CLAM
   NetworkEditor currently it needs the oscpack library installed. You will find 
   the tarball in the CLAM web (download).

   - Go into CLAM/build/srcdeps and run 'make'
   - Go into CLAM/build and run:
     $ autoconf -f
     $ ./configure
     This script will complain if doesn't found some needed dependent libraries.
     Some of them are completely optional: libportaudio, libportmidi,
     libxml++. So don't worry if ./configure reports failure on any of these.
     (See also the list of needed packages at the end)

3. Build NetworkEditor 
  - Edit CLAM_NetworkEditor/build/clam-location.cfg so that CLAM_LOCATION
    variable is the path (absolute or relative) to the CLAM dir.
  - Go into CLAM_NetworkEditor/build/Tools and run :
    $ make depend && make CONFIG=release 

Now you should be able to run ./NetworkEditor

You can also use the .xml files of networks patched with NetworkEditor with the Prototyper.
