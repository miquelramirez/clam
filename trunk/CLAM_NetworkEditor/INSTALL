This file explains how to compile and install the CLAM applications 
from the source tarballs.

 1. Install CLAM dependencies

 Please refere to the INSTALL file in the CLAM (library) tarball.
 
   
 2. Compile CLAM libraries from the tarball
 
 Please refere to the INSTALL file in the CLAM (library) tarball.


 3. Compile the CLAM application.
 From the root of NetworkEditor source, supposing that clam sources are at 
 '../CLAM' and CLAM binaries were installed at prefix /usr/local:

     $ scons install install_prefix=/usr/local clam_prefix=/usr/local \
	      clam_sconstools=../CLAM/scons/sconstools/

 For further building options do :

     $ scons --help

 Notice that if you are using a non-standard clam_prefix, you might 
 need to make the LD_LIBRARY_PATH to point to the CLAM lib directory.
