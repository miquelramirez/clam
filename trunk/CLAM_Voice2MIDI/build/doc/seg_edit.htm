The following figure shows the elements available for editing in the segmentation mode:

<br>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="pics/seg_edit1.png" width="400" height="438"></p>

<p><br>
The <b>scroll bar</b> is used to move back and forth along the audio signal.<br>
Clicking on the arrow to the right of the scroll bar advances the screen 0.2 seconds<br> 
along the signal, while clicking on the arrow to the left of the scroll bar reverses<br>
0.2 seconds.<br>
Clicking on the area of the scroll bar which is <b>not</b> occupied by the slider will move<br> 
the screen forward or back by 1 second, depending on whether you have clicked<br> 
to the right or the left of the slider.<br>
Finally, it is possible to move along the audio signal by manipulating the slider directly<br>
with the mouse and moving it to the right or to the left.
<br><br>

The <b>display area</b>, shows the data obtained in the analysis vs the estimated values in the<br> 
process of segmentation. From top to bottom:<br>
<br>
<b>- Audio</b>.<br>
<b>- Energy</b>.<br>
<b>- Energy</b> of the notes which make up the melody.<br>
<b>- Fundamental</b>.<br>
<b>- Pitch</b> of the notes which make up the melody.<br>
<br>
If you click and hold the left mouse button over the beginning or end time of a note (the<br> 
red vertical lines), the cursor will change shape to a horizontal arrow indicating that the<br> 
limit can be moved to the left or the right. To change the length of the note, hold the left<br> 
button down and move the mouse to the left or right. Release the mouse button and the<br> 
cursor will return to the original shape and the beginning/end of the note remains in the<br> 
desired position.<br>
When modifying the length of a note it is possible to link or eliminate notes, or both<br> 
functions at the same time depending on the circumstances.
<br>

<p><br>
Modifying the start or end time of a note will cause a corresponding change in the length<br> 
of the associated segment (note).  If you join the beginning and end times of a note, the<br> 
note will be eliminated from the melody.<br> 
When a beginning/end time being edited is joined to the start or end point of a different<br>
note, the notes will become linked.  The previous figure shows and example of several<br>
linked notes and one which is not linked. 

<br><br>
The <b>panel</b> shows information about the note being edited.  If there is no note being edited<br> 
then the fields will not contain any information.  If any modifications are made, the <b>Save</b><br> 
button is activated which provides the option of saving the changes.

<br>

<p><br>
The first line of labels shows information about the amplitude, energy and fundamental pitch<br>
of the data obtained from the spectral analysis. The second line of labels shows the values<br>
of energy and pitch for the note being edited. The third lines shows the start and end time<br>
of the note (t1 and t2) and its duration. 

<br><br>
By pushing the right mouse button over the display area a pop-up menu appears.<br>
This menu offers the option to <b>Save</b> current changes, as well as the option to undo<br>
the latest action (<b>Undo</b>), or the option to discard all changes back to the last time<br> 
the melody was saved (<b>Discard</b>).

<br>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="pics/popup_menu.png" width="100" height="86"></p>

<p><br>
Using the <b>Undo</b> option it is possible to undo a total of 20 actions made after the previous<br>
<i>save</i>.

<br><br>
The segmentation view is synchronised with the 
<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4" color="#008800">
<a href="pianoroll_view.htm">Piano Roll view</a></font>
, so any actions taken in<br> 
this view will be reflected in the other.
