This file explains how to compile and install the CLAM applications 
from the source tarballs.

 1. Install CLAM dependencies

 Please refere to the INSTALL file in the CLAM (library) tarball.
 
   
 2. Compile CLAM libraries from the tarball
 
 Please refere to the INSTALL file in the CLAM (library) tarball.


 3. Compile the CLAM application.
 From the root of NetworkEditor source, suposing that CLAM binaries
 were installed at prefix /usr/local:

     $ scons install prefix=/usr/local clam_prefix=/usr/local

 if you are not using Linux/Debian (or Ubuntu) you'll need to define QTDIR
 hint: in Fedora Core 6 use QTDIR=/usr

 For further building options do :

     $ scons --help

 Notice that if you are using a non-standard clam_prefix, you might 
 need to make the LD_LIBRARY_PATH to point to the CLAM lib directory.

--
 Single command to recompile and install clam and then this application:

 $ (cd ../CLAM && scons && scons install) && scons && ./NetworkEditor

 When doing development the recommended procedure to run designer and
 prototyper with plugins without installing is:

    $ cd NetworkEditor
    $ export QT_PLUGIN_PATH=.
    $ mkdir designer
    $ scons && cp libCLAMWidgets.so designer
    $ designer-qt4
    $ ./Prototyper
