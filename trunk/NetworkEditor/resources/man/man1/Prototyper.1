.TH Prototyper 1 "August 24, 2005" "version 0.1.2" "User Commands"
.SH NAME
Prototyper \- Runs CLAM networks with a Qt interface
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B Prototyper [Network.xml [Interface.ui]] [-d backend1 [-d backend2]...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The Prototyper runs audio processing networks created by the
CLAM NetworkEditor (.clamnetwork) using a Qt user interface (.ui)
created by the Qt Designer to control it.
Qt widget names on the interface will be used to connect the widgets
the proper network elements.
See the CLAM NetworkEditor tutorial for more detailed explanation.
If no interface is provided on the command line, the Prototyper
will look for an interface with the same name than the network
and the proper extension.
If anything else fails then a minimalistic default interface
will be used.
You can also provide a list of audio backends to try.
Most common backends are 'alsa', 'jack', 'portaudio'...
They will be probed in order and the first one working will be 
selected. If none of the selected works then the default list
of backends for the platform will be tried.
