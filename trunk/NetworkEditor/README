= CLAM Network Editor ver 0.2.1 =

== Overview ==

The CLAM Network Editor is a tool for editing CLAM processing networks.
Those processing networks can become the processing core of an application
by using the CLAM::NetworkPlayer class in your program or by using
the CLAM Prototyper to link the network to a Qt Designer interface.

See the CLAM doxygen documentation on how to use the CLAM::NetworkPlayer
class.

The CLAM Prototyper comes into several flawours depending on the audio
subsystem you want to use: Prototyper (for native sound application),
Prototyper-jack (for jack support on linux and macosx) and Prototyper-pa
(for using the PortAudio abstraction layer).
