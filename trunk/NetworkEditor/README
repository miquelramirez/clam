= CLAM NetworkEditor =

The CLAM Network Editor is a tool for editing CLAM processing networks.
Those processing networks can become the processing core of an application
by using the CLAM::NetworkPlayer class in your program or by using
the CLAM Prototyper to link the network to a Qt Designer interface.

== NetworkEditor usage ==

Note: this is valid for Linux and Mac OSX:

NetworkEditor will try to start jackd if it is installed in the system 
To use PortAudio instead of jack do the following:
- Make sure that jackd is not running
- Define JACK_NO_START_SERVER environment variable to avoid starting jackd automatically.
  for example:
  $ JACK_NO_START_SERVER=1 ./NetworkEditor

== Prototyper usage ==

 Usage: ./Prototyper <networkfile> [ <uifile> ] [-o] [-b <backend> [-b <backend> ...]]
Options:
 -o             Non interactive mode
 -b <backend>   Try backend (portaudio, alsa, jack).
