Description: CLAM Network Editor, prototyping tool for CLAM
 The CLAM Network Editor is a tool for editing CLAM processing networks.
 Those processing networks can become the processing core of an audio
 application by using the CLAM::NetworkPlayer class in such program, 
 or by using the CLAM Prototyper to link the network to a Qt Designer
 interface.
 .
 This packages provides both the Network Editor and the Prototyper.
 It also provides a plugin for Qt Designer which adds widgets
 to display several kinds of CLAM audio objects from a running network.

 Those processing networks can become the processing core of an audio
 application by using the CLAM::NetworkPlayer class in such program, 
 or by using the CLAM Prototyper to link the network to a Qt Designer

 .
 This package provides examples of networks, some of them with 
 their user interface to be executed also by the Prototyper.
 Those examples include, among others, some sinusoidal plus residual 
 modelling (SMS) transformations and tonal (chords, notes) analysis.
