- Polishing connector interface:
	- Dummy_NetworkProxy.connectorInfo failure case (assert? exception?)
	- Index and type are queried to the proxy instead of passed as constructor parameters and stored as attribute. For tests using constructor parameters instead of a definition structure we can keep these attributes, query the proxy just when they are None
	- If we have properties, do we need a dicctionary to hold Connector attributes?
	- PeerConnectors should not receive type as parameter
	- PeerConnectors
	- Connector.peers no se usa/testea
	- PeerConnectors.__len__()
- Connecting
	- Test Connector.connect(Connector)
		increments the peers
		increments the peer peers
		many kinds:
			output first
			input first
			controls
			ports
		error conditions
			different kind
			same direction
			different type
	- Test Connectors.connect(Processing)

- Network interface:
	- Processing factories for the dummy proxy
	- Adding a processing
	- Self generation code
	- Introspection for processings
	- Adding processings
		- Factory
	- Self writting code for processings
	- Self writting code for connections
