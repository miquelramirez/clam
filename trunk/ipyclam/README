ipyclam: Interactive CLAM for Python

What is this
============

ipyclam provides interactive exploration and manipulation
of CLAM networks from a python console/script.

How similar is that to pyCLAM
=============================

While pyclam are python bindings exposing the whole CLAM
C++ API for python, this project just tries to provide
high level primitives to manipulate CLAM networks.

The file API.txt describes the target API.

Status:
======

This project is still under development. The API is still
subject to changes and some features are not implemented yet.
But main features are implemented and it is already 
functional and useful.

See the TODO file for more details on what's to do and
what's done.
