ipyclam: Interactive CLAM for Python

What is this
============

ipyclam provides interactive exploration and
manipulation of CLAM networks from a python console.

How similar is that to pyCLAM
=============================

While pyclam are python bindings exposing the whole CLAM
C++ API for python, this project just tries to provide
high level primitives to manipulate CLAM networks.

The file API.txt describes the target API.

Status:
======

This project is still under development.

Most of the explorative API is already implemented:
Connectors, Processings, Connections, and Configurations
can be explored given a network proxy. But the current
network proxy is based on a dummy data structure that
simulates the real CLAM one. Regarding the interface
the main tasks to do are implementing the manipulation 
bit (adding and removing processings, stablishing and 
removing connections, configuring the processings).
Also implementing all the Network external interface.
The other big task i implement a real network proxy
based on CLAM. This description might get outdated
soon so see the TODO file for more details on what's 
to do and what's done.
