Some indications in order to compile the examples in this folder
----------------------------------------------------------------

These examples use qt4, so you have to do some changes in your
CLAM build system to compile them.

1. CLAM/build/system-posix.cfg:
   1.1 Change the path for qt includes to point to your qt4 includes.
   1.2 Change the path for qt libs to point to your qt4 libs.
   1.3 Change the libraries to link against. Remind that qt4 doesn't use
	   qt-mt library, but several ones.

2. CLAM/build/Makefile.rules:
   2.1 Change moc command to /path_to_qt4_root_dir/bin/moc in order to compile
	   moc files.
   2.2 Change uic command to /path_to_qt4_root_dir/bin/uic in order to compile 
	   ui files. At the moment there are not ui files to compile in these
	   examples but is best to chage it anyway.

Once you have made the above changes, you can enter to the common folder and
put the path to your CLAM-qt4 copy in clam-location.cfg.
Then enter to some example folder and just type: make CONFIG=release to build the example.

* Hint about selecting zoom refs and regions:
- You can select a point as a x zoom ref by: Key_R + LeftButton
- If you wish to select a region, you can do it by: Key_Shift+Key_R+LeftButton
- Once you have a selected region, you can adjust it using the mouse.
