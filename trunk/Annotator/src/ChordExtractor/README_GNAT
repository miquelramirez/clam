gnat v0.1
---------

A small audio collection tool to associate local audio files with semantic web URIs.

Gnat creates small RDF files in the folders of your music collection, such as :

/music
/music/Artist1
/music/Artist1/AlbumA/info_metadata.rdf
/music/Artist1/AlbumA/info_fingerprint.rdf
/music/Artist1/AlbumB/info_metadata.rdf
/music/Artist1/AlbumB/info_fingerprint.rdf

These can then be used by a tool such as gnarql[1] to expose this information through a SPARQL endpoint and allow futher information to be gathered about your collection.

REQUIREMENTS
------------

- Written and tested on python 2.4 but may work fine on 2.3 or 2.5 - let us know if you try :)
- Python libraries :
  - rdflib v2.4.0 [2] (easy_install)
  - mutagen v1.11 [3] (easy_install)
  - musicbrainz2 SVN later than 02/08/2007 (sorry) [4]

- genpuid [5] (included)
- mopy [1] (included)

USAGE
-----
- Track lookup based on local metadata :
./AudioCollection.py metadata /path/to/music

- Track lookup based on MusicDNS fingerprinting :
./AudioCollection.py fingerprint /path/to/music

- Clean all .rdf files :
./AudioCollection.py clean /path/to/music

Note : the metadata and fingerprinting lookups may safely be run in parallel.
