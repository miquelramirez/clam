This file explains how to compile and install the CLAM applications 
from the source tarballs.

 1. Compile CLAM libraries and their dependencies. Note that Annotator need
 Qt4.1 or above.
 
 Please refer to the INSTALL file in the CLAM (library) tarball.

 2. Compile the CLAM-vmqt module

	From the vmqt directory type
    $ scons clam_prefix=/usr/local

 3. Compile the CLAM Music Annotator.

    From the CLAM-Annotator source root type:
	$ scons clam_prefix=/usr/local prefix=/usr/local

 4. Install the CLAM-Annotator

    $ scons install

 For further building options do :

	$ scons --help

 Notice that if you are using a non-standard clam_prefix, you might 
 need to make the LD_LIBRARY_PATH to point to the CLAM lib directory.


 Windows specific:
 -----------------

 1. Before starting the compilation you might need to set up the Visual Studio environment
 vars by executing 
   
    vcvars32.bat

 2. Before compiling CLAM, you'll need the QTDIR variable pointing to the Qt3 dir.
 But before compiling Annotator, you'll have to change QTDIR so it points to Qt4.1 dir

 3. Our build-system based on Scons uses Visual Studio as a compiler back end.
 So you'll need you'll need Qt4.1 for Visual Studio.
 This web explains how to patch Qt4.1.2 open source (prepared to work on MinGW) so that it  
 works on Visual Studio:

 4. In the windows platform you could also build a package (the XXX-setup.exe file) 
 by typing on a shell:

    $ scons package


Mac OSX specific
-----------------

Compilation in OSX is still to be tested
