 IMPORTANT (1 april 2007) ubuntu qt4-dev does not install libmysql correctly.
 if linkage of Voice2MIDI gives this problem
 /usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lmysqlclient_r

 do the following:
 $ cd /usr/lib
 $ sudo ln -s libmysqlclient_r.so.15.0.0 libmysqlclient_r.so

 or install mysql devel package.

 the issue has been notified upstream (qt) so is expected to be solved
 in next releases.

 From the root of Voice2MIDI source, suposing that CLAM binaries
 were installed at prefix /usr/local:

	$ scons install prefix=/usr/local clam_prefix=/usr/local

 Notice that if you are using a non-standard clam_prefix, you might 
 need to make the LD_LIBRARY_PATH to point to the CLAM lib directory.
