 IMPORTANT (1 april 2007) ubuntu qt4-dev does not install libmysql correctly.
 if linkage of Voice2MIDI gives this problem
 /usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lmysqlclient_r

 do the following:
 $ cd /usr/lib
 $ sudo ln -s libmysqlclient_r.so.15.0.0 libmysqlclient_r.so

 or install mysql devel package.

 the issue has been notified upstream (qt) so is expected to be solved

This file explains how to compile and install the CLAM applications 
from the source tarballs.

 1. Install CLAM dependencies

 Please refere to the INSTALL file in the CLAM (library) tarball.


   
 2. Compile CLAM libraries from the tarball
 
 Please refere to the INSTALL file in the CLAM (library) tarball.


 3. Compile the CLAM application.

	$ scons

 If you wish to use CLAM libs installed in a non-standard dir, you 
 will need to specify the clam_prefix :

	$ scons clam_prefix=~/mylibs/ install
 
 For further building options do :

	$ scons --help

 Notice that if you are using a non-standard clam_prefix, you might 
 need to make the LD_LIBRARY_PATH to point to the CLAM lib directory.
