<br>
You will see a graphic representation similar to the following figure:


<br>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="pics/piano_roll_view.png" width="557" height="437"></p>

<p><br>
This view offers the possibility of editing the beginning and end times of the notes<br>
as well as the option of eliminating notes from the melody (see 
<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4" color="#008800">
<a href="edition.htm">Editing</a></font>).<br><br>

The upper part of the left panel has 3 buttons.  Each of these buttons activates a<br> 
different view in the data display (the upper display) as shown in the figure.
<br><br> 

<b>- S: </b>Original audio<br>
<b>- E: </b>Energy<br>
<b>- P: </b>Fundamental Frequency (Pitch)<br><br>

The pitch of the notes is labelled using the universal nomenclature and the letters appear<br> 
on the left of the panel.  For more information on the representation of octaves see<br> 
<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4" color="#008800">
<a href="octave.htm">Representation of octaves</a></font>.<br><br> 

The panel in the lower part of the display offers information about the note being edited:
<br><br>

<b>- MIDI: </b>the first line of labels (Key, Veloc, Pitch) indicates the midi values and pitch,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;written in universal nomenclature, for the note being edited. After the pitch, the<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;number of the octave of the note being edited is also shown.
<br><br>

<b>- Analysis: </b> the second line of labels (A, Energy, Pitch) indicates the values for amplitude,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; energy and pitch based on the data obtained from the spectral analysis.
<br><br>

The group of labels marked <b>note time</b>  in the figure shows information about the<br> 
beginning and end times and the duration of the note being edited.
<br><br>

The Save button is used to save any modifications made whilst editing.  In addition,<br> 
the display incorporates a pop-up menu which is accessed by pressing the right mouse<br> 
button over the display area. This menu offers other editing functions besides those<br> 
mentioned here (see
<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4" color="#008800">
<a href="edition.htm">Editing</a></font>).<br>
