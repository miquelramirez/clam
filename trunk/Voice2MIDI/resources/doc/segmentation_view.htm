<br>
You will see a graphic representation similar to the following figure:


<br>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="pics/segmentation_view.png" width="500" height="434"></p>

<p><br>
This view offers the possibility of editing the beginning and end times of the notes<br>
as well as the option of eliminating notes from the melody (see 
<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4" color="#008800">
<a href="edition.htm">Editing</a></font>).<br><br>

The panel in the lower part of the display offers information about the note being edited:
<br><br>
<b>- Analysis: </b>First row of labels (A, Energy, Pitch) that indicates values of amplitude,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;energy and pitch based on the data obtained in the spectral analysis.
<br><br>

<b>- Segmentation: </b>Second row of labels (Segmentation ->...) that indicates the values of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;energy and pitch obtained in the segmentation for the note that is being edited.
<br><br>

The group of labels marked <b>note time</b>  in the figure shows information about the<br> 
beginning and end times and the duration of the note being edited.
<br><br>

The Save button is used to save any modifications made whilst editing.  In addition,<br> 
the display incorporates a pop-up menu which is accessed by pressing the right mouse<br> 
button over the display area.  This menu offers other editing functions besides those<br> 
mentioned here (see
<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4" color="#008800">
<a href="edition.htm">Editing</a></font>).<br>
