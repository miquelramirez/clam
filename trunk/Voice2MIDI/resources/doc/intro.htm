Voice2MIDI is an application that allows the conversion of a singing voice audio signal<br>
in wave format into its MIDI equivalent by using spectral analysis techniques.<br>
<br>
The application includes the following functionalities:
<br><br>
• Capturing the signal with the use of a microphone.<br>
• Saving and loading audio files in wave format.<br>
• Reproducing the original audio.<br>
• Viewing the shape of the wave of the original signal.<br>
• Dynamic viewing of the wave during audio reproduction and capturing.<br>
• Spectral analysis of the audio signal in order to obtain the characteristics that allow<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; for the extraction of the melody contained in the signal.<br>
• Frame by frame viewing and consultation of the results obtained in the analysis.<br>
• Reproduction of the fundamental frequency of the signal.<br>
• Extraction of the melody based on the characteristics obtained during the analysis.<br>
• Reproduction of the extracted melody.<br>
• Viewing and editing of the extracted melody.<br>
• Conversion of the melody into MIDI.<br>
• Viewing and editing of the MIDI melody.<br>
• Synchronization of the different editing views.<br>
• Reproduction of the MIDI melody using the instruments available in the application<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; (piano, trumpet, etc.).<br>
• Saving the result into a MIDI file.<br>
• Saving the melody and its MIDI equivalent in an XML file.<br>
