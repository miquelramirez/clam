The application has a characteristic pitch of 5 octaves, labelled 2-6.<br>
This does not represent the entire range of a grand piano, and is much<br>
less than is offered by the MIDI protocol, however greatly exceeds the<br> 
vocal range of any singer.<br>
Each octave is associated with a determined colour as in the following figure:</font>

This is the colour code used to represent the octaves of the notes in the Piano Roll View.
<br><br>

The colour will be lighter or darker depending on the velocity of the note. At lower velocity<br>
the colour will be darker, and at higher velocity it will be lighter. The colours, from left to right,<br>
are red, magenta, cyan, blue and grey.<br><br>

In the case of red and blue, the variation in the proportion of the colour will affect<br> 
the components of red and blue respectively.<br><br>

For magenta and cyan, the proportion of the colour determined by the velocity of the note<br> 
will affect the components of blue and green respectively.<br><br>

With the grey, the three components will be affected equally.
