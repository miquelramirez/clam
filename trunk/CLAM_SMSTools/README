How to compile SMSTools in GNU/Linux :
--------------------------------------

1. Make shure that you have unpacked both CLAM and CLAM_SMSTools tarballs 
   in the same directory.

2. Configure CLAM
   - Go into CLAM/build/srcdeps and run 'make'
   - Go into CLAM/build and run:
     $ autoconf -f
     $ ./configure
     This script will complain if doesn't found some needed dependent libraries.
     Some of them are completely optional: liboscpack, libportaudio, libportmidi,
     libxml++. So don't worry if ./configure reports failure on any of these.
     (See also the list of needed packages at the end)

3. Build SMSTools 
  - Edit CLAM_SMSTools/build/clam-location.cfg so that CLAM_LOCATION
    variable is the *absolute* path to the CLAM dir.
  - Go into CLAM_SMSTools/build/Tools and run :
    $ make depend && make

Now you should be able to run ./SMSTools
