Setting (by hand) a configuration parameter that is a bool as a string
("false" or "true"), should make an assert, but instead makes the parser
hang, and consume more and more memory

The correct behaviour should be raising an XmlErr on the number not found, not asserting.
The failing backend was Xerces but other may fail too.
