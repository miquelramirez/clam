Windows NetworkEditor installer installs the plugins but they are not
available. The problem is that the plugins can not be loaded because
they depend on dll available in a different location not in the PATH.
Possible solutions:
* The installer adds lib/plugins in PATH environment so that the required dlls are available
** Adding a nsis library and using it http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Path_Manipulation
* The program launcher sets the path
** My ideal solution, but no idea how to do that in windows. Anyone?
* Install the plugins into bin, but requires further filtering in order not to load non-plugin dlls in that directory
** Filtering by present symbol is nice but I do not know whether lazy load works in windows.
** Filtering by name patters is weak but could work
