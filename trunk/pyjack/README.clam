This directory contains the the code of the py-jack project in
https://sourceforge.net/projects/py-jack/

The reason why we have commit it here is that we want to maintain a set of patches. Hopefully they will eventually be integrated with the original project.

For local install
python setup.py install --home=~/local
export PYTHONPATH=~/local/lib/python"
