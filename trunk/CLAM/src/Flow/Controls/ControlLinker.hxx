 * This class is not used by now. 25 March 2003. As a result of a refactoring
 * Is expected that will realive (or some similar class) when we have to deal 
 * with networks that exports controls and ports.
 *
 *
 * This class is a base class of InPort and OutPort and also 
 * can be instantiated. Instances of ControlLinker are used as
 * control input/output of the groups of processing objects: it holds
 * a Linker among the outPorts (or other ControlLinker that acts as outPort)
 * of the outter world of the group and the inner InPorts (or ControlLinkers
 * acting as InPorts). And the same on the other direction: we use the
 * ControlLinkers to export a number of OutPorts (or CLs) to the outter world
 * of the group.
 * \see InPort 
 * \see OutPort

 * This class provides an interface to obtain all the "concrete" InPorts and
 * OutPort connected, along 
 * with functions for modifying the links between this ControlLinker and 
 * others. 
 * \warning This class is just temptative. It is likely to be
 *		soon depracated
