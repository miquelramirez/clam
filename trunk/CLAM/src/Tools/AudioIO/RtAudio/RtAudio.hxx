/*! \class RtError
    \brief Exception handling class for RtAudio.

    The RtError class is quite simple but it does allow errors to be
    "caught" by RtError::TYPE. Almost all RtAudio methods can "throw"
    an RtError, most typically if an invalid stream identifier is
    supplied to a method or a driver error occurs. There are a number
    of cases within RtAudio where warning messages may be displayed
    but an exception is not thrown. There is a private RtAudio method,
    error(), which can be modified to globally control how these
    messages are handled and reported.

    process can also be shutdown and the user function de-referenced
    through an explicit call to the cancelStreamCallback() method.
    Note that a single stream can use only blocking or callback
    functionality at the same time, though it is possible to alternate
    modes on the same stream through the use of the
    setStreamCallback() and cancelStreamCallback() methods (the
