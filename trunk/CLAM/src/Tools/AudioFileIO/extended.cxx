/*
** This code is taken from aiff.c from libsndfile by Erik de Castro Lopo
** http://www.zip.com.au/~erikd/libsndfile/libsndfile-1.0.1.tar.gz
** 
** This is a rough hack at converting from 80 bit IEEE float in AIFF header to an
** int and back again. It assumes that all sample rates are between 1 and 800MHz,
** which should be OK as other sound file formats use a 32 bit integer to store
** sample rate.
**
** There is another (probably better) version in the source code to the SoX but it
** has a copyright which probably prevents it from being allowable as GPL/LGPL.
**
** Another, very complete, implementation of the same conversions, written by
** Ken Turkowski <turk@computer.org> is available at
** http://www.worldserver.com/turk/opensource/ToFromIEEE.c.txt
