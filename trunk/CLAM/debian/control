Description: runtime package for the CLAM framework
 CLAM is a framework to develop audio and music applications in C++.
 It provides tools to perform advanced analysis, transformations and synthesis,
 visualization for audio and music related objects, and other tools that are
 useful to abstract target platform for most tasks in an audio applications
 such as audio devices, file formats, threading...
 . 
 This package contains the files needed to develop with the following libraries:
 clam-core, clam-processing, clam-audioio, clam-vmfl and clam-vmqt libraries.
