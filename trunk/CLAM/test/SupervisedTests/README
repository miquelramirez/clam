Here goes the tests that needs human interaction.
Create only this kind of test if there is no feasible way to make
them automatically checked.
You should provide explicit intructions on testing and a checklist 
of test conditions the tester should check in order to pass the test.
If you usually test something that is not in the checklist consider
adding it.
