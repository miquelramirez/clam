== Instructions ==

Note: By now only tested in linux, but all the tools are cross-platform and should also work in mac and windows in similar way.

=== Tools (assuming a working clam dev environment) ===
- Install Boost.Python: sudo apt-get install libboost-python-dev libboost-python1.34.1
- Get gccxml[1] version 0.9 (standard deb package at common repos is about 0.7). I took from here:  http://ftp.zcu.cz/pub/linux/debian/pool/main/g/gccxml/gccxml_0.9.0+cvs20080525-1_i386.deb or compile from CVS.
- Download and install Py++[1] (no package at ubuntu repos)
  'sudo python setup.py install'
  Py++-0.9.5.zip at https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=118209&package_id=157697
- Download and install pygccxml[1] (no package at ubuntu repos):
  'sudo python setup.py install'
  pygccxml-0.9.5.zip: http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=118209&package_id=146545
- Enable indexing suite version v2:
  PYPLUSPLUS='Py++-0.9.5/indexing_suite_v2/indexing'
  BOOST_INDEXING='/usr/include/boost/python/suite/indexing'
  sudo cp $PYPLUSPLUS/* $BOOST_INDEXING/

[1] Only needed for bindings regeneration. Not for compiling.

=== Compilation ===
- Run `scons configure prefix=CLAM_LIBRARY_PATH` to specify desired CLAM library installation prefix ('/usr/local' by default).
- (optional) Apply the pyhacks.patch to FFT_ooura.hxx at CLAM include directory in order to allow some hacked features. Is temporay, just for testing purposes!
- Run `generate_binding.py` and then compile the bindings with `scons` command. After those steps you should get the clam.so ready to use.
- Run the examples at examples directory: fft_example.py and playfile.py or play with the library from a console with IPython.
