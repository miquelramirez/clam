== Instructions ==

Note: By now only tested in linux, but all the tools are cross-platform and should also work in mac and windows in a similar way.

=== Tools (assuming a working clam dev environment) ===
# Install Boost.Python. At debian based distros packages named libboost-python-dev and libboost-python1.34.1
# Download and install[1] Py++ (no package available, at least at standard ubuntu repos)
  Download Py++-0.9.5.zip from https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=118209&package_id=157697
  and execute 'sudo python setup.py install'
##* Enable indexing suite version v2:
    PYPLUSPLUS='Py++-0.9.5/indexing_suite_v2/indexing'
    BOOST_INDEXING='/usr/include/boost/python/suite/indexing'
    sudo cp $PYPLUSPLUS/* $BOOST_INDEXING/
# (optional [1]) Get gccxml version 0.9 (Warning: standard debian package at repos usually is about 0.7). I took it from here:  http://ftp.zcu.cz/pub/linux/debian/pool/main/g/gccxml/gccxml_0.9.0+cvs20080525-1_i386.deb, the option is compile it from CVS. Note: I experienced some problems with the very last CVS version, the one from 20080525 is preferred.
# (optional [1]) Download and install pygccxml[1] (no package available, at least at standard ubuntu repos):
  Download pygccxml-0.9.5.zip from http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=118209&package_id=146545
  and execute 'sudo python setup.py install'

[1] Only needed for bindings regeneration. Not for compiling.


=== Compilation ===
# Patch the CLAM library. At the CLAM source dir, execute: 'patch -p0 < pyclam.patch' and re-install the library (run 'scons install' from CLAM dir).
# At pyclam dir, run 'scons configure prefix=CLAM_LIBRARY_PATH' to specify the desired CLAM library installation prefix.
# Run 'generate_binding.py' (will generate a bunch of files at 'src' directory) and then compile the bindings with 'scons' command.

After those steps you should get the clam.so ready to use.


=== Use ===
* Put the clam.so file in a visible place for your scripts (PYTHONPATH or the directory where your scripts are placed).
* Import the library as usual: 'import clam' or 'from clam import *' as your convenience.
* Try the examples at examples directory (fft_example.py, playfile.py, etc) and/or check unit tests to have a better idea of how to work with the library.
* Play interactively with the library from a console with IPython.
