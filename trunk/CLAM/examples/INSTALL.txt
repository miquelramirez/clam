Once installed CLAM, you can compile them with:
 $ scons clam_prefix=/usr
Change /usr to the path CLAM is installed on.

Beside the ones needed to compile CLAM you will need a number 
of extra libraries available such as:
* aubio (http://aubio.org)
* samplerate (http://www.mega-nerd.com/SRC)

 Debian/Ubuntu
 (do "sudo apt-get install <packages>")
 libsamplerate0-dev libaubio-dev
