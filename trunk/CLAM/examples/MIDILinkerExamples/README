This example shows how to use MIDILinker class in order to add easily MIDI support to any application, so we can modify values of the Processing controls we specify.

There are two different executables, 'make MIDILinker_example' builds an application where we have two oscillators. We can change the frequency of these by playing a MIDI keyboard (one changes with MIDI Note on, and the other with MIDI Note off).

The other is the same example, but now we have a GUI where we can select the messages and values that change the processing controls selected.
It can be compiled by typing 'make FLTK_GUI_MIDILinker_example'.
