This is a still under development example on how
to build a VST plugin given a CLAM network and
a Qt Designer file.

Most source files will eventually be moved to CLAM
library so that ClamVstPlugin.cxx is the only source
user should write.

You need to download the VST SDK 2.4 directly from
Steinberg, since its licence doesn't allow us to
distribute it. Use the vstsdk_path SCons option
to make it point the proper place.

This example can be compiled just on Windows or 
crosscompiled from Linux with a crosscompiled CLAM.

What works:
- The network is properly loaded and executed
- AudioSinks and AudioSources are exported as Ports.
- ControlSources are exported as Parameters.
- The ui interface is loaded as plugin editor.

What doesn't work:
- Loading errors are silently ignored
- The user interface does not take the ui size but a fixed one
- The interface is still pretty useless (no communication)
- Some ui events are not properly handled (focus, d&d...)
