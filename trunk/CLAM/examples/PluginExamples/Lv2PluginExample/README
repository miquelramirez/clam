This is an example on how to build LV2 plugins based on CLAM networks.
LV2 support in CLAM is still experimental so expect changes on how they
are built. Suggestions and patches are welcome.

sudo apt-get install lv2core (debian/ubuntu)

scons clam_prefix=....
scons install # it installs in ~/.lv2

Most of the building relies on the clam_lv2_generator script,
which is provided by the framework and generates ttl files,
manifest files and a minimal main c++ file which loads all
the networks and present them as a plugin.

GUI stuff is still WIP. Feel free to experiment with it
but no warranty.
