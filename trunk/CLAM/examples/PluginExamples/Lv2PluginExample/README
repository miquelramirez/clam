This is an example on how to build LV2 plugins based on CLAM networks.
LV2 support in CLAM is still experimental so expect changes how they
are built. Suggestions and patches are welcome.

sudo apt-get install lv2core (debian/ubuntu)

1: Edit the file network_and_uri.config. Format is:
	relative/path/to/network    lv2/uri     name
2: python generateFileToCompile.py
3: make
4: sudo make install


TODOs
- Embed the network in the so or make it part of the bundle
- Enhance multi-plugin library support
- Integrate qt based ui's
