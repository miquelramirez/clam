First of all, I would like you to note that this Spectral Delay
is completely unrelated with the Native Instruments notorious
VST plug-in. Consider it an attempt at reverse-engineering :)

Then also note the app current version number: it "works" in the
sense that it loads and saves files, allows you to press and
move around the knobs, and even does some "processing" on streaming
audio. But unfortunately, there has been not time to make it sound
well, or at least not to sound horrible.

===============================
1 - What is Spectral Delay for?
===============================

The "Spectral Delay" is just a bank of filters with delays attached
that work on frequency domain. It acquires its input from the input
file you select with the GUI, processes ( or messes ) it
and then renders the output to your system sound device. It also
saves the processed (or messed) audio to the output file you selected.

=================
2 - How to use it 
=================

I expect it to be quite intuitive, but as feedback is sent to 
CLAM mailing list, this section will grow in size.

===================
3 - How to build it
===================

It's pretty easy, you just have to remind to setup your local "sandbox"
as reported on the CLAM website, and once setup you just run the autoconf,
the configure and then go back to the directory you found this README file
and then:

	make SpectralDelay_FLTK

if you want a light-weight GUI
or

	make SpectralDelay_Qt

if you want a light-weight GUI ( and a bit nicer ).

Yes, there are two versions of the GUI, one developed with FLTK 
( http://www.fltk.org ) and the other one with the famous Qt (http://www.trolltech.com)
It's pretty the same thing but I find it too look nicer under X11 with
FLTK than with Qt due to the horrible Windoze MDI emulation Qt does.
