'That will be CLAM 1.0 release'
 * SVN Revision: 9864
 * New binary in NetworkEditor/ called OfflinePlayer to batch-process
   clam network files given an input and output audio file.
 * Fixes in the modconf to work in suse (thanks Toni)
 * Updated Fedora Core packaging
 * PortAudio network player backend:
   * PortAudio available in all platforms, including Linux.
   * Network player gets priority boost in Linux.
   * Discarded OSS API so in linux it uses Alsa (#Closes 200).
   * Xruns are notified on the console.
   * Available apis and devices are notified on the console.
   * Stream is closed and open on network start and stop.
 * All network players
   * AudioSink/Sources does the copy on the Network 'Do' instead
     of an explicit one.
   * The player just sets the device buffer using the new 
   * XNetworkPlayer::IsWorking to test whether a given NP is available.
   * Backends uses the framesize set by the backend
   * TopologyChanged protocol removed (Closes #174).
 * Flow control
   * Added a NaiveFlowControl which is less than optimal but
     it has been developed in a test driven way considering 
     most of the cases PushFlowControl was failing and some
     others. See the test cases for more info. (Closes #175)
   * No need to explicitly set the flow control to a network; by
     default it has a Naive one. Now all CLAM code uses the default.
 * FFTW3
   * Support for FFTW3 as FFTW_fftw3 and IFFTW_fftw3 classes.
   * FFT and IFFT processings inherits from the faster enabled 
     implementation on the compile options (fftw3, fftw2, oura).
   * All the FFT implementations including the generic 'FFT' are
     available to the Processing Factory (and thus in NetEditor).
   * FFT and IFFT default sizes are set to 1024 instead 0.
 * Examples folder can be moved arround and build with a local SConstruct

2005-07-21 CLAM 0.8.0
'Prototyper with streaming SMS transformations'
  * SMS Transformations on the network editor:
     ** All SMS Transformations have been refactored in order to work
        in streaming mode and not only in offline mode.
  * New Prototyping way:
     ** Prototyper: Allows to bind a Qt desinger interface to a
        Network XML definition so you can have an CLAM GUI application
        up an running without a single line of code. Current features:
        *** It uses the widget names and classes to Automagically relate
            widgets to processings, ports and controls.
        *** Binds sliders, knobs and so to in-controls on the network
        *** Binds monitoring plots to out-ports on the network
        *** Binds buttons to play/stop actions on the network
  * QtPlots add-ons: 
     ** Editable segmentation marks on all the plots   
     ** QtSpectrogram:
	*** Plot to view sonogram (Color/B&W)
     ** BPFEditor:
	*** Editable/auralizable plot (Audio and MIDI support)
  * Compiler compatibility:
     ** CLAM and its applications now compiles in GNU g++3.4 (as well as 3.3)
  * Audio file I/O facilities:
     ** MP3 I/O: Bug fixed: that prevented XING headers from being used to
        compute duration
     ** MP3 I/O: Bug fixed in conversion from milliseconds to seconds
     ** Vorbis I/O: Feature addition: now the # of samples is computed for
        Vorbis bitstreams
  * Memory leak review:
     ** FFT internal buffer was not freed on destruction
  * XML related changes:
     ** Now XmlStorage::Dump does indentation by default. A new optional
        parameter disables indentation.
     ** XercesC 2.6 is required in order to pass the tests and be memory
        leak free (even 2.3 should be enough to compile and run CLAM).
     ** XML Storage Error Handling (This solves issue #0000022):
        *** Catchable CLAM::XmlStorageErr excepetions are thrown whenever:
            **** I/O error happens
            **** Malformed XML is readed
            **** Read elements or contents does not match with CLAM objects
                 structure
            **** CLAM objects detect some semantic constraints.
     ** XPath (like) navigation (This solves issue #0000045):
        *** The implementation of XmlStorage::Select allows using:
            **** XmlStorage::AppendToDocument(object, path, filename)
            **** XmlStorage::RestoreFromFragment(object, path, istream)
            **** Using atomic primitives for doing some similar hacks like
                 writing fragments of the XML for an object to disk.
     ** Alternative XML Backends (LibXml++)
        *** Unification of the way XmlStorage interfaces the library dependant
            code.
        *** LibXml++ Backend implemented. It is planned to be the default
            backend on future releases but still some work is needed to get
            the error messages correctly reported.
  * Network refactoring:
     ** Published{In|Out}{Controls|Ports} -> {In|Out}{Control|Port}Registry
  * Descriptors:
     ** SpectralDescriptors::HighFrequencyCoefficent -> HighFrequencyContent
        as specified by the original literature.
  * Other:
     ** ConnectPorts overloaded to connect free ports (that is not belonging
        to any processing, normally used for injecting or extracting data)
  * Build System:
     ** Changes in order to not abort ./configure script when some library is 
        not found (and not specifyed with the --without-libname option)


2004-11-18 CLAM 0.7.0
'Easier deployment, better plots and Processing Networks'
  * Processing Ports Infrastructure Complete Rewrite:
     ** Now effectively works with any datatype (i.e. InPort<Spectrum>)
     ** Shortcut CLAM::ConnectPorts with either ports numbers and names
     ** Shortcut CLAM::ConnectControls with either control numbers and names
     ** Underlying data structure for streaming tokens is specified using a 
        Template-Policy
        *** Default policy is PhantomBuffer: an contiguous-memory circular 
            buffer with some nice feature
        *** But also usable any STL container
     ** Internal (implementation) classes hierarchie has been simplified a 
        lot.
     ** Thoroughly (unit) tested, and stress tested
     ** Stream class now can be policy-templatized to PhantomBuffer or any 
        STL container
     ** New ports-linking schema : only out->in (and not out->data or 
        in->data)
        *** Ports Attach(ProcessingData&) method has been deprecated.
        *** Please refer to the migration guide and doxygen docs
     ** New AudioIn/OutPorts. Similar tor In/OutPort<TData> but with richer 
        interface
     ** New feature: In/OutPortPublisher 
        *** A composite port that "publishes" one or more inner ports.
        *** When linking a port with a publisher it acts like a mediator for 
            its published ports.
     ** New In/OutPort public interface
        *** Constructors. Now gets only two parameters, and not the window 
            size anymore
        *** Size and Hop getters and setters, GetData, Consume, Produce, 
            CanConsume, CanProduce, etc.
  * SMSAnalysis-Synthesis In Streaming:
     ** Till this release SMSAnalysis and SMSSynthesis needed a Segment as 
        intermediate data now they can also use ports to process in streaming
  * NetworkEditor:
     ** Added SMSAnalysis and SMSSynthesis in the processings factory. But 
        still some problemes needs to be sorted out.
  * AudioFile IO:
     ** AudioFile have easier and clearer interface:
        *** AudioFile::SetHeader is obsolete
        *** AudioFile::SetLocation is obsolete, instead use:
        *** AudioFile::OpenExisting
        *** AudioFile::CreateNew
  * Processing Interface Clean up:
     ** Removed Processing inheritance from Component
     ** Processing::FlattenObjects removed until needed
     ** Processing::SetPrototypes/UnsetPrototypes removed until needed
     ** Processing::MayDisableExecution removed until needed
     ** Processing::DisableExecution removed until needed
     ** Processing::LostData removed until needed
     ** Processing::StoreOn/LoadFrom removed until needed
     ** Processing::composite_begin/end moved to the ProcessingComposite
  * Low Level Descriptors Revision (Audio, Spectral and SpectralPeaks):
     ** Full doxygen documentation.
     ** Formulas revised and corrected.
     ** Most NaN singularities has ben solved. Check doxygen.
     ** Unit testing and back-to-back testing for every descriptor.
     ** Asserts that source data is in linear format
     ** SpectralDesc Skew/Kurstosis -> MagnitudeSkew MagnitudeKurtosis
     ** Spectral and Harmonic Tilts removed (Returned very unstable values)
  * Beta Qt Plots:
     ** Audio (playable).
     ** Fundamental (playable).
     ** Spectrum.
     ** Spectrum and peaks.
     ** Sinusoidal tracks.
     ** Some examples at CLAM/build/Examples/Simple/QtPlots
     ** Note that these widgets are in the initial development phase.
     ** Extra requirements: qwt library.
  * Standard:
     ** FormatData.hxx removed, also their useless uses
     ** Vector removed
     ** QSort removed, use stl's qsort instead
  * Test Framework:
     ** Qt testing GUI for Linux (activate USE_QT)
     ** Infrastructure for reading basic Data (wav,xml)
     ** Back to back testing infrastructure
     ** Improvements to the python script to run all tests and apps
  * Doxygen documentation:
     ** XML documentation modules added.
     ** Documentation module on Configurators: Autogenerated Qt/Fltk dialogs 
        to edit DynamicTypes.
     ** More scatered changes and fixes.
  * Build System:
     ** Full rewrite of configure.ac. configure.ac is now generated from a 
        perl-script which does a lot of code-reuse to create a consistent and 
        uniform configure.ac.
     ** configure generates HAS_<library> values (in packages.cfg), which is 
        used by srcdeps to make sure USE_<library> and HAS_<library> is 
        consistent. Using USE_<library>=$(HAS_<library> in settings.cfg can 
        be used to make usage conditional. On windows the user should make
    sure that the build/packages-win.cfg file is reflecting his system
     ** configure has a new way to present the user with the possibity to 
        disable the use of specific libraries. If the user does not have a 
        specific library, it can tell configure not to use it. The generate 
        HAS_<library> value will be false, and if a settings.cfg tries to use 
        it, srcdeps will notice it. This allows to compile certain examples 
        that don't use libraries you don't have.
  * MS Visual support:
     ** MS Visual 6 is no longer supported.

2004-04-13 CLAM 0.6_1
'qt && Visual 7 support'
  * General:
     ** Some memory leaks removed with Valgrind
     ** Added backward compatibility with gcc 2.95
  * Build System:
     ** Added support for MS Visual 7. Srcdeps now generates .vcproj
     ** Support for QT library preprocessor steps in linux, mac and windows : 
        visual6 and visual7:
        *** Moc objects generated automatically from mocable headers.
        *** Moc objects generated from UIC files.
     ** Integration of all the platforms code ( linux and mac Makefiles, 
        windows .dsp and .vcproj generated from the same program).
  * XML:
     ** Fix: Storing arrays with size 1 crashes
     ** Fix: IterableAdapter joined array elements when basics
  * MIDI I/O:
     ** Added MIDI output
     ** Added virtual devices for midi-to-text out
     ** PortMIDI now also works on Linux
     ** Simplified MIDI input (see documentation)
  * Descriptors:
     ** More fixes on SpectralFlatness, LowFrequencyEnergiRelation and 
        Rolloff:
        *** SpectralFlatness uses log10 instead log
        *** LowFrequencyEnergiRelation doesn't modify the incoming data
        *** RollOff uses Energy instead Moment<O1> and compares with the 
            square
     ** Moved to Stats: Tilt, Slope, Flatness
  * SMSTools:
     ** Bug fixes related to the logics of menu's options 
        activation/deactivation (related to the state of application).
     ** Solved a bug that crashed SMSTools when trying to load an XML 
        analysis.

2004-02-18 CLAM 0.6.0
'Audio file formats: Reloaded'

  * Network Editor:
     ** Added support for ladspa plugins inside the GUI
     ** Support to change the name of processings
     ** Support for new Audio File I/O processings
     ** Now is possible to know the state of a given processing and the error 
        message (if it exists).
  * Audio File I/O Support:
     ** Four new processings available for reading/writing from audio files:
        *** MonoAudioFileReader/Writer ( single channel reading and writing )
        *** MultiChannelAudioFileReader/Writer ( multi channel reading and 
            writing )
     ** New AudioFile class. This class models the concept of 'audio file' 
        which has attached attributes as 'Location' ( the path to the file ), 
        'Header' ( the concrete file header information such as length, 
        samplerate, etc. ) and 'TextDescriptors' (text-based meta-data such 
        as Artist, Title, Album, etc. )
     ** New File formats supported:
        *** Almost any PCM-based audio data storage scheme encoding/decoding 
            is supported through libsndfile ( 
            http://www.zip.com.au/~erikd/libsndfile )
        *** Ogg/Vorbis encoding and decoding support
        *** Mpeg Audio Layer 1/2/3 decoding support
     ** New Feature: Partial retrieval of textual metadata embedded in files. 
        For now CLAM is just able to extract information such as Artist, 
        Title, Album and Track number. Support for a wider range of textual 
        descriptors extraction will be available soon.
        *** ID3 metadata frames retrieval from Mpeg bitstreams
        *** Vorbis Comments retrieval from Vorbis bitstreams MacOS X note: 
            ID3 meta-data extraction only works for MacOS X 10.3 systems and 
            above, since Apple did not include Unicode ( wchar_t ) support in 
            their libstdc++ binary distribution.
     ** Three new examples showing how to use the new Processing's and the 
        AudioFile class:
        *** examples/FileInfo_example.cxx
        *** examples/AudioFileReading_example.cxx
        *** examples/AudioFileWritiing_example.cxx their build projects can 
            be found on the build/Examples/Simple folder
  * FFT refactored:
     ** Removed duplicated code and unused functionality and improved 
        efficiency.
  * Salto:
     ** Fix: several potentially dangerous out-of-bounce array accesses in 
        fltk G.interface
  * Processing Data:
     ** Documented (doxygen style) that the time unit is miliseconds in 
        Audio, Frame and Segment
  * Processings:
     ** AudioFileIn stamps the sample-rate to the written audio
  * Descriptors:
     ** AttackTime is based on the envelope
     ** Fix: LogAttackTime recalculated the AttackTime always
     ** New AudioDescriptors: Decrease
     ** New SpectralDescriptors: Slope and Spread
     ** Functional tests added
     ** Fixes and precission enhancements
  * Tests:
     ** All unit and functional tests have been merged in only two 
        executables (settings.cfg), namely: AllUnitTests and 
        AllFunctionalTests

'Tomorrow MacOsX patch'
  * SMSTools:
     ** Fix: Closing window crashed on MacOsX.
     ** Fix: Storing output global sound stored sinusoidal in previous release
  * Base:
     ** [Experimental] Support for Polymorphic attributes in DT
  * XML:
     ** Abstract types thru Polymorphic attributes
     ** XMLStaticAdapter is deprecated
  * Network Editor:
     ** Better layout on processing configuration dialogs
     ** Fix: integer fiels on processing configuration dialogs were limited 
        to 99. Now it uses std::numeric_limits
     ** Fix: Network serialization loading was broken
     ** Some processings still in draft moved to example files
  * Simple Examples:
     ** FlowControlExamples tree has been moved to draft since simpler and 
        more concrete examples now exists: examples/NetworkUsage_example and 
        examples/PortsAndControlsUsageExample/
     ** Examples have been ported to use the XML static XMLStorage methods
     ** Some broken examples have been fixed, including 
        compiling_against_clam and SpectralDelay.
  * Windows Build System:
     ** Updated .dsp Visual 6 projects that were outdated in previous release
     ** Fixed some minor problems in some settings.cfg files
  * Salto:
     ** Fix: Did not compile in previous release. Example in general is still 
        outdated though.

2004-01-12 CLAM 0.5_6
'XML and Ladspa rewrite'
  * XML:
     ** Both, basic XMLStorage usage interface and customization interface 
        have changed. Check 'Migration Guidelines' on the documentation and 
        update your code.
     ** Ported to XercesC 2.3. Library dependant code is more isolated and 
        structured so libxml or expat ports will be easy.
     ** Atomical operations are available so partial loading or document 
        updating is now more feasible.
     ** One statement calls using static methods XMLStorage::Dump and 
        XMLStorage::Restore
     ** Trapable error notification using exceptions.
     ** API Change: XMLStorage::Store and XMLStorage::Load receives a 
        const-ref and a ref to adapters instead a pointer
     ** API Change: Component::StoreOn is now a const method.
     ** Scoped XML: [Experimental] allows (write only) fast XML generation 
        without having to define CLAM data.
     ** Cppunit Tested and general code clean up
  * Network Editor:
     ** Smarter conections display (control conection with vertical tangent 
        and that wires always goes outward the processing)
     ** Refactoring of the application structure.
     ** Bug fixing.
     ** Created Unit Tests for the entire application.
  * Processing Objects:
     ** GetName has been removed from all CLAM processing configurations 
        because it was not really useful.
     ** Simplified Processing interface related to ports and controls.
  * Error handling:
     ** Failed assertions dump a backtrace in GNU/Linux.
  * SMSTools:
     ** Fix: SDIF storage was unconfigured on release mode.
     ** fixed compilation with g++ 2.95.4 (Debian Woody), fixed SMS Tools 
        build 
  * Descriptors:
     ** Added descriptors to compute on a whole segment.
     ** Added basic arithmetic operators to descriptors.
     ** General debugging.
  * LADSPA:
     ** Rewrited and simplified support to create LADSPA plugins using CLAM.
     ** New support for using LADSPA plugins as CLAM Processings.
  * Build system:
     ** Fix: some fltk-config nagging options removed on aclocal

2003-11-26 CLAM 0.5.5

  * General:
     ** Code cleanup
  * Visualization Module:
     ** Bug that provoked Sinusoidal tracks to pop has been fixed
     ** Bug that prevented some code to compile fixed
  * Examples/NetworkEditor:

     ** DescriptorsComputer added: now there is the possibility of computing 
        statistics for Spectrums, SpectralPeakArrays, Frames, etc
  * MacOSX Support:
     ** build system changes
     ** RtAudio for Audio I/O
  * Audio I/O:
     ** A generic RtAAudioDevice for all platforms (includes some platform 
        specific workarounds)

2003-11-06 CLAM 0.5.4

  * Build system:
     ** Added 'Compiling_against_CLAM_example' subdir to the build dir. It 
        contains an out-of-the-box example of how a CLAM external aplication 
        can compile against the library. It contains a tutorial in its 
        'readme.html' file. Since now it was a separated tarball available in 
        the web. Now integrated in the CLAM dir tree.
     ** Configuration:
        *** Use fltk-config to get the paths to fltk includes/paths
        *** QTDIR support
     ** Added rules to pre-process headers with moc (QT)
     ** Add .dsp files for many CLAM programs
     ** Fixed many settings.cfg files under Windows
     ** srcdeps:
        *** Run srcdeps when settings.cfg has changed
        *** Don't look through xerces include directories recursively
        *** Performance improvements
        *** Bugfixes
        *** Generate from empty dsp
  * Standard/Misc:
     ** Text: Added to the standard as substitution for std::string on those 
        case when we need multiword strings on XML. (XML loads only one word 
        for std::strings)
     ** BPF: Modified BPFTmpl<>::Insert() (both overloads) to return the 
        index at which the element was actually inserted (i.e. the inserted 
        element's index).
     ** CLAMMath: Fixed a bug in Round() and Chop() which caused the fpu 
        control word to be changed when calling these functions (but only in 
        debug build).
     ** Moved some includes from hxx's to cxx's and doing forward decl to 
        improve compilation speed
     ** Working towards supporting MacOSX/PPC (including byte order issues)
     ** Added a FileMIDIDevice
     ** SoundFileIO improvements ( support for more sample formats added, 
        better errors)
     ** Declare template specializations in header inline ( gcc 3.x 
        compatibility issue )
  * ProcessingData:
     ** SpectralPeakArray ProcessingData; when adding an IndexArray to an 
        already existing SpectralPeakArray and calling InitIndices(), the 
        IndexArray would be allocated to the actual number of elements in the 
        other arrays, not their allocated size (i.e. the maximum elements 
        they can hold without reallocating).
     ** Fundamental ProcessingData; removed two Dynamic Type attributes which 
        were used to keep track of the size and allocated size (max size) of 
        the Fundamental. These values are now derived from either of the 
        arrays (freq/err). Also calling SetnCandidates() or 
        SetnMaxCandidates() now actually affects the arrays instead of merely 
        setting the size fields. This is more consistent with 
        SpectralPeakArray for instance.
     ** Audio ProcessingData: bug fixed in GetAudioChunk method that left 
        extracted chunks with uninitialized Sample Rate and Begin Time
     ** Spectrum Conversions: Added a method called Complex2LogMagPhase() 
        which efficiently converts a complex spectrum to a log. magnitude 
        (i.e. in dB's)/phase spectrum.
  * Processing:
     ** SMSAnalysis: fixed a bug that lead to divisions by zero
  * FlowControl:
     ** Added interface to network in order to connect/disconnect controls
     ** Serialization of network, including connections (ports/controls) and 
        processing configurations.
  * Testing:
     ** CLAMTEST_ASSERT_XML_EQUAL to compare XML canonically
     ** Helpfull colors for finding differences on expected and obtained 
        strings
     ** Added CppUnit workspace
     ** Added a shell-script to generate the dsp's.
     ** Created a project for all functional tests
     ** Several tests moved to "SupervisedTests"
     ** Visualization (Plots)
     ** XMLAdapters
     ** Threading
     ** PersistenceThroughDTs
     ** SMS Application FunctionalTests
     ** Morphing
     ** Several processing tests
     ** Network Serialization
     ** Text
     ** ProcessingController
     ** ControlAdapter
     ** Fl_FundFreq (supervised)
  * SMS:
     ** Removed MaxSines from peak detection configuration and replaced it 
        with the much more useful MaxFreq
     ** Several bugfixes and code cleanups
     ** New transformations
  * New examples:
     ** FilePlayback
     ** ProcessingLifeCycle
     ** Persistence_Throught_DTs
     ** StereoToMonoFile
  * Examples - NetworkEditor
     ** Improved GUI
     ** Controls
     ** Configuration of processings from interface.
     ** Serialization

2003-10-4 CLAM 0.5.3
'Starting the new course'

  * Build system:
     ** Bug fix in srcdeps: uninitialized var in emptydsp.c
     ** Fix: 'configure' test for local sandbox fftw in linux, used wrong 
        parameters order
     ** Added support to fltk-config in order to get fltk paths and flags
     ** Changed "release" flag compilation in gcc from -O6 to -O3
  * Visualization Module:
     ** Next generation VM Plots available. Check the examples for 
        indications on how to use them.
     ** SMS Tools widgets for Spectrum, Audio, etc. promoted to VM standard 
        presentations.
  * Processing - General:
     ** Many ugly warnings removed
     ** CleanTracksConfig FreqDev parameter semantics changed to match the 
        meaning of SinTrackingConfig FreqDev.
  * Processing - Analysis:
     ** New LPC_AutoCorrelation Processing object added to spectral analysis 
        Processings set
     ** The SpectralPeakDetect Processing class now no longer alters it's 
        given ProcessingData if it's different than expected, but instead 
        checks it using an assert. Also, a bug was fixed which tried to use 
        an uninitialized index variable when setting the values for the last 
        spectral peak.
     ** The FFT_rfftw and FFT_ooura Processings were missing a return on 
        SetPrototypes() which only generated a compiler error when 
        CLAM_ASSERT was disabled.
  * Processing - Synthesis:
     ** The IFFT_rfftw Processing was missing a return on SetPrototypes() 
        which only generated a compiler error when CLAM_ASSERT was disabled.
  * Processing - AudioFileIO:
     ** AudioFileIn should now be capable of loading PCM encoded files with 
        sample formats of 8, 16, 24 or 32 bits/sample
  * ProcessingData - BasicProcessing:
     ** New LPModel (Linear Predicitve Model) ProcessingData object added to 
        basic Processing data objects. Allows conversions to CLAM::Spectrum.
  * Standard:
     ** Bug fixed in BPF that caused applications to crash when trying to use 
        the Spline value interpolation method
  * Examples - Miscellaneous:
     ** Usage example of FDFilterGen (Frequency Domain Filter Generator ) 
        Processing object added to examples/ folder
     ** Usage example of FFT_rfftw Processing object updated
     ** Usage example of LPC_AutoCorrelation Processing object added to 
        examples/
     ** Example explaining how to play a given .wav file added to examples/
     ** Example about Segment and SDIF I/O added to examples/
     ** Examples explaining how to use new VM Plots added to examples/

2003-07-25 CLAM 0.5.2
'Processing bug-fixing, SMSTools update'

  * Processing - Transformation - SMS:
     ** SMSMorph was not working by a side-effect of the introduction of the 
        SMS Time Stretch.
     ** SMSMorph: All controls except Residual Spectral Shape are fully 
        functional.
  * Processing - Analysis:
     ** SpectralPeakDetect infinite loop bug fixed.
     ** Added New Ooura FFT algorithm.
  * Standard:
     ** Stack, Queue and String removed. Use the STL ones instead.
     ** Obsoleted DescStats removed.
  * BuildSystem:
     ** Library generation for both Linux and Windows. (Still not CLAM 
        binaries but user libraries)
  * Examples - Miscellaneous:
     ** AudioFileIO example, explaining how to load and save a sound file is 
        available
  * SMSTools - v.0.1.1
     ** GUI - Score Editor:
        *** UI screen texts tweaked so they result more informative
        *** Added new and improved SMS Morph transformation control widget, 
            allowing user a finer grain level of control on that SMS 
            transformation. Also SMS Morph transformation description has 
            been completely rewritten.
        *** Bug fixed: under some circumstances configuration widgets might 
            be unadvertendly duplicated, leading to invalid transformation 
            scores
        *** Editor widget layout tweaked a bit to make bigger the screen area 
            devoted to transformation parameters edition


2003-07-03 CLAM 0.5.1
'SMSTools update and Mac compilation issues'

  * Examples - SMS:
     ** Improved stability and performance.
     ** Fixed a few bugs in how some configurations were handled
     ** Removed some useless fields from configuration i.e. 
        PhaseManagementType and changed AnalysisMaxSines for 
        AnalysisPeakDetectMaxFrequency.
     ** Transformations Configurators: graphical widget for editing 
        configurations.
     ** New view added (fundamental)
     ** SMSMorph transformation is now usable.
     ** SMSTime stretch is also usable.
     ** SMSEdu (from amora's career final project project) available as 
        'draft'.
  * Examples - Misc:
     ** NetworkEditor (from xrubio's career final project) available on 
        'examples'
  * Processing - All:
     ** Configs has been separated from their processings in a separate 
        header to lower memory usage during SMSTools compilation in Mac.
  * Processing - Analysis:
     ** Spectral peak detect does not have MaxPeaks as a configurations 
        parameter. Instead, you may indicate the maximum peak frequency you 
        want to detect with MaxFreq.
  * Processing - Transformation -SMS:
     ** SMSTransformation chain is now able to acknowledge SMSTransformations 
        that do not process inplace and have different processing rate.
  * Testing:
     ** Some more test has been moved to cppunit framework
  * Doxygen:
     ** Few doxygen inline documentation fixes
  * BuildSystem:
     ** Library generation under Linux available (still not for a CLAM lib 
        but for generating user libraries)

2003-06-11 CLAM 0.5.0
'flashing new build system and SMSTools'
  * Build system:
     ** New flashing build system, fast, crossplatform and easy to use
     ** Configuration file for each binary is shared between platforms
     ** Automatic detection of binaries dependencies
     ** Automatic generation of dsp's and make dependencies
     ** See the documentation for more details
     ** Depends on FLTK 1.1.3 instead 1.0.X
  * Processing - All:
     ** Concreteconfigure should asserts false instead throwing bad_cast 
        exceptions when a wrong type of configuration is provided.
     ** Provided a helper template function 'CopyAsConcreteConfig()' to be 
        used in ConcreteConfigure instead using slow dynamic_cast's.
     ** Most Processing in CLAM adapted to use 'CopyAsConcreteConfig'.
  * Processing - Generator:
     ** Oscillator had a heavy compilation dependency since it used 
        AudioManager for initializing sample-rate. Now it doesn't (uses 44100 
        as default)
  * Processing - Analysis and Synthesis:
     ** SMSAnalysis uses a StreamBuffer with one write region and two read 
        regions
     ** SpectralAnalysis does not have an internal CircularBuffer anymore
     ** SpectralSynthesis does not have OverlapAdd as an internal Processing 
        anymore
     ** Now SMSSynthesis has three OverlapAdd Processings for each component: 
        global, sinusoidal and residual.
     ** OverlapAdd now uses a StreamBuffer with one WriteRegion, one 
        AddRegion and one ReadRegion.
     ** CleanTracks is much more faster, (and then usable)
  * Flow - Network & FlowControl:
     ** New Network and FlowControls classes that works quite together: 
        Network manages processings ownership, nodes, gives simple interface 
        for stablishing processing topologies. FlowControls gets the topology 
        from the associated network and does its processing-firing scheadule. 
        The scheaduling algorithm is reimplementable now we have a 
        pull-scheadule implementation
     ** Limitation: only tested for fixed buffer size.
  * Flow - Nodes:
     ** New pure virtual interface for attaching ports and traversing 
        processings
     ** Some refactoring simplifying checking logic. Further refactoring in 
        progress
     ** A new AddStreamRegion has been introduced (used for overlap and add).
     ** StreamRegions can be now used using center position logic.
     ** StreamRegions belonging to a StreamBuffer are now automatically 
        initialized so the center time is zero and the first half of the 
        biggest read region is already written with zeros.
     ** Limitation: Do using ports (supervised mode) only tested with fixed 
        size buffers.
  * Factory:
     ** Added a general purpose factory which is templatized by the abstract 
        product (returned type). Nested class Registrator helps registering 
        concrete classes to the factory.
  * Standard:
     ** Added the Filename type to be used in configurations instead of 
        std::string. Configurators detect them and use a suited widget.
     ** Flags: Flags derived classes should define the copy constructors 
        explicitly. One parameter template constructors is not enough (it 
        never was)
     ** Array: debugged the copy constructor when array does not own memory 
        and introduced a CopyChunk method, similar to GiveChunk but with 
        memory copying.
  * DynamicTypes:
     ** Fix: Definition of DynamicTypes on foreign namespaces leaded to 
        compilation problems if you don't use the ugly 'using namespace 
        CLAM;'.
     ** Fix: dynamic type self-assignation doesn't modify the object.
  * Examples - SMS (old AnalysisSynthesisExample):
     ** FlowControlExamples. Gives examples of use of networks and 
        flow-control.
     ** Renamed as SMS. GUI is now SMSTools.
     ** Applies chained SMS transformations
     ** Menu reorganization
     ** New views: sinusoidal tracks, spectrum & peaks
     ** Frame navigator
     ** Fixes and performance enhancements
  * Examples - Other:
     ** Fix: The Tutorial4 didn't compile (used Complex in an old fashioned 
        way).
  * XML:
     ** New method XMLStorage::UseIndentation to enable pretty XML formatting
     ** Obsoleted constructor receiving the root tag as parameter
     ** Obsoleted _restoreFrom and dumpOn, use Dump and Restore instead
  * Visualization Module:
     ** Major rework in several areas:
  * View concept has now been mapped into two different classes, 
    ModelAdapter's whose mission is to wrap Core CLAM objects so they can 
    have Visualization Module components attached, and ModelController's 
    whose mission consists in allowing Visualization Module components to be 
    controlled indirectly by the user from the GUI. From now on VM interface 
    will be kept stable ( at least until CLAM 1.0 )
  * Presentation semantics are preserved, but their nature of widgets is 
    emphasized in several ways
  * Several new graphic representations of DSP concepts such as the 
    sinusoidal tracks
  * OpenGL data renderers optimized and debugged
  * Old CbLib interface deprecated in favor of libSigSlot, CLAM own 
    implementation of the C++ idiom of Signals & Slots
  * New plot's substitute the functionality offered by old snapshots
  * Most of VM code is now documented with Doxygen comments
  * Several new FLTK widgets, such as the Fl_Axis, Fl_SmartTile, etc. 
     ** Configurators: New type suported: 'Filename'
     ** 'Formal' documentation will be soon made publicly available

2003-03-05 CLAM 0.4.2
'Cuidado merge update'

  * Processing - ArithOps:
     ** Fix: BinOps threw 'this' (the processing) on error instead exceptions
     ** Some concrete BinOps have Personalized names for the class
     ** Some concrete BinOps have Concrete Configuration alias (You can use 
        AudioAdderConfig instead BinaryAudioOp < Add<TData> > )
  * Processing Data:
     ** Added Correlation
  * Standard:
     ** TemplateCircularBuffer obsoleted by CircularBuffer

     ** libsigslot added
  * FLTKConfigurator:
     ** Uses FL_Pack & FL_Scroll for managing the widgets position

        GLPortSigSlot and capabilities to get its Signals and its Slots.
  * GLPortSigSlot:
     ** New class added, derived from GLPort, that includes Signals and 
        Slots, and the methods to work with them, as well as an overlay that 
        draws the Frame marker.
  * MSVisualC++ build system
     ** Changed extended.c to extended.cxx. Used by 
        Tools/AudioFileIO/AIFFFileIO
     ** CLAM_Windows.hxx used instead windows.h to work arraund some nasty 
        defines
  * SpectralDelay

        for Windows... by now)

2003-01-23 CLAM 0.4.1
'Analysis Synthesis debuggin'

  * General:
     ** Fix: Component::GetClassName has changed the signature to const 
        (#0111)
     ** GetClassName gets pure virtual on Component to reveal 
        misredeclarations
  * Unix build system:
     ** Better support for external projects
     ** $(CLAM_PATH)/ prefix needs to be added on for each filename on 
        '.files' files
  * Spectral Analysis:
     ** Fix: WindowGenerator Enums symbols had illegal spaces on their inside
  * AnalysisSynthesisExampleBase:
     ** default HopSize is now computed from residual window size
     ** SynthHopSize has disappeared: only frameSize is used (affects also 
        SMSAnalysisSynthesisConfig.hxx)
     ** Max number of sines of Peak Detect and SineTracking are now 
        configured using configuration value
  * Audio:
     ** GetAudioChunk now allows to ask for a chunk with begin time beyond 
        the original audio limits. It just returns zeros but configures the 
        chunk if necessary.
  * SMSAnalysisConfig:
     ** Buffer Size of both spectral analysis (sinusoidal and residual) is 
        configured after the largest window size (this condition is necessary 
        for handling different window sizes in both components).
  * SpectralPeakDetect:
     ** Added a condition so the loop breaks whenever we have more peaks than 
        those indicated in MaxPeaks (Note: here the algorithm should be 
        changed to decide what are the n best peaks, not the n first peaks: 
        TODO)
  * SMSAnalysis:
     ** Sample rate was not correctly initialized under some conditions

'Zero padding move'

  * Analysis Synthesis example:
     ** Removed useless synthesis zero padding factor
     ** Fixed some other bugs related to zero padding
     ** Did a little modification in the GUI so Audio displays are closed 
        when editing configuration

2002-11-26 CLAM 0.4.0-rel
'Fly examples, fly to seattle' release

  * General:

2002-02-27 CLAM 0.2.1-rel

  * Array class:
     ** Changed the Resize/SetSize semantics, fixing some remaining bugs. 
        This has important consequences:
        *** Order is now important! Do Resize() first, then SetSize().
        *** You need to do SetSize() with a proper value before trying to 
            access an element in the array.
     ** Added a STL based implementation (_MTG_USE_STL_ARRAY flag)
     ** Empty arrays do not dump an "Empty" string when Storing.
