What is the Prototyper ?
------------------------ 
Is a small aplication that launches a network host with a qt gui on its top.
It receives an .xml (network definition) and a .ui (qt design) files as arguments

How to compile the Prototyper

1. Compile the QtPlugin
  in CLAM/build/Examples/QtDesignerPlugins
  $ make depend && make

2. Install QtPlugin
  in CLAM/build/Examples/QtDesignerPlugins
  $ make install (no need to be root)

3. Check qt plugins path 
  run qtconfig, Library Paths tab and add 
  /path/to/home/.kde/lib/kde3/plugins

4. Compile and run Prototyper
  in CLAM/build/Examples/Prototyper
  $ make depend && make
  $ ./Prototyper SMSmess.xml SMSmess.ui  (for example)


How to Create new prototypes
------------------------------

  You can open SMSmess.xml with NetworkEditor (CLAM application) 
  and open SMSmess.ui with designer (qt application)
  to see how qt widgets are binded with elements of a CLAM network.

  It is basically a matter of writting a name attribute following 
  an easy syntax  to refere a port or control of the network.
