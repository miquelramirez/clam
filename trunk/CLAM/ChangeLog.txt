  * Build system:
      ** New flashing build system, fast, crossplatform and easy to use
      ** Configuration file for each binary is shared between platforms
      ** Automatic detection of binaries dependencies
      ** Automatic generation of dsp's and make dependencies
      ** See the documentation for more details
      ** Depends on FLTK 1.1.3 instead 1.0.X
  * Processing - All:
      ** Concreteconfigure should  asserts false instead throwing bad_cast
         exceptions when a wrong type of configuration is provided.
      ** Provided  a  helper  template  function  'CopyAsConcreteConfig()' to be
         used in ConcreteConfigure instead using slow dynamic_cast's.
      ** Most Processing in CLAM adapted to use 'CopyAsConcreteConfig'.
  * Processing - Generator:
      ** Oscillator had a heavy compilation dependency since it used AudioManager
         for initializing sample-rate. Now it doesn't (uses 44100 as default)
  * Processing - Analysis and Synthesis:
      ** SMSAnalysis uses a StreamBuffer with one write region and two read regions
      ** SpectralAnalysis does not have an internal CircularBuffer anymore
      ** SpectralSynthesis does not have OverlapAdd as an internal Processing anymore
      ** Now SMSSynthesis has three OverlapAdd Processings for each component: global,
         sinusoidal and residual.
      ** OverlapAdd now uses a StreamBuffer with one WriteRegion, one AddRegion and
         one ReadRegion.
      ** CleanTracks is much more faster, (and then usable)
  * Flow - Nodes:
      ** A new AddStreamRegion has been introduced (used for overlap and add).
      ** StreamRegions can be now used using center position logic.
      ** StreamRegions belonging to a StreamBuffer are now automatically initialized
         so the center time is zero and the first half of the biggest read region is
         already written with zeros.
  * Standard:
      ** Added the Filename type to be used in configurations instead of
         std::string. Configurators detect them and use a suited widget.
      ** Flags: Flags derived classes should define the copy constructors explicitly.
         One parameter template constructors is not enough (it never was)
      ** Array: debugged the copy constructor when array does not own memory and
         introduced a CopyChunk method, similar to GiveChunk but with memory copying.
  * DynamicTypes:
      ** Fix:  Definition  of  DynamicTypes  on  foreign  namespaces  leaded  to
         compilation problems if you don't use the ugly 'using namespace CLAM;'.
  * Examples - SMS (old SMSAnalysisSynthesis):
      ** Renamed as SMS. GUI is now SMSTools.
      ** Applies chained SMS transformations
      ** Menu reorganization
      ** New views: sinusoidal tracks, spectrum & peaks
      ** Frame navigator
      ** Fixes and performance enhancements
  * Examples - Other:
      ** Fix:  The Tutorial4 didn't compile (used Complex in an old fashioned
         way).
  * XML:
      ** New method XMLStorage::UseIndentation to enable pretty XML formatting
      ** Obsoleted constructor receiving the root tag as parameter
      ** Obsoleted _restoreFrom and dumpOn, use Dump and Restore instead
  * Visualizatiom:
      ** Final Visualization Module design using SigSlot library. (see Documentation)
      ** New FLTK presentations
      ** Plots substitutes Snapshots
      ** Configurators: New types suported: 'Filename', 'BPF'.

  * MSVisualC++ build system
      ** Changed extended.c to extended.cxx. Used by Tools/AudioFileIO/AIFFFileIO
      ** CLAM_Windows.hxx used instead windows.h to work arraund some nasty defines

     ** Max number of sines of Peak Detect and SineTracking are now configured using configuration value
  * Audio:

        returns zeros but configures the chunk if necessary.
  * SMSAnalysisConfig:
     ** Buffer Size of both spectral analysis (sinusoidal and residual) is configured after the largest window
        size (this condition is necessary for handling different window sizes in both components).
  * SpectralPeakDetect:
     ** Added a condition so the loop breaks whenever we have more peaks than those indicated in MaxPeaks
        (Note: here the algorithm should be changed to decide what are the n best peaks, not the n first peaks: TODO)

2002-02-27  CLAM_0_2_1-rel

  * Array class:
      ** Changed the Resize/SetSize semantics, fixing some remaining
         bugs. This has important consequences:
         *** Order is now important! Do Resize() first, then SetSize().
