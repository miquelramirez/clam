Description: CLAM framework plugins
 CLAM is a framework to develop audio and music applications in C++.
 It provides tools to perform advanced analysis, transformations and synthesis,
 visualization for audio and music related objects, and other tools that are
 useful to abstract target platform for most tasks in an audio applications
 such as audio devices, file formats, threading...
 .
 This package provides several plugins extensions for the CLAM audio
 framework, which are already provided by the CLAM project including:
  * OSC support
  * Real-time 3D acoustics scene simulation (ambisonics, raytracing, HRTF's)
  * Speech synthesis and analysis
  * Simple SMS based synthesizer
  * Guitar effects
  * Sample by sample convolution effects
  * Lock-free wave file reader

 This package provides development files needed to compile C++ code referring
 specific symbols in libclam-plugins. This package is not required to use
 plugins as long as the processing object defined in them are created by means
 of factories and manipulated using the abstract interfaces in libclam-core.
