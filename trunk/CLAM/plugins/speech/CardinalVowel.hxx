	  \class CardinalVowel
	  \brief  This class returns formants 1 and 2 for the cardinal vowels
	  
	  The cardinal vowels are reference vowels that can be used to
	  place vowels from unstudied languages.  There are 4 front
	  and 4 back vowels, starting with the high front IY and
	  ending with the high back UW: IY EY EH AE AA AO OW UW
	 
	  This class assumes as input a continuum from 0 (IY) to 1
	  (UW) and maps the values between 0 and 1 to first and second
	  formant of vowels along the cardinal vowel progression
	  
	  \TODO the second input, the number of steps will represent
	  discrete steps along the path of cardinal vowels.  For the
	  cardinal vowels series, the number of steps = 8.  Setting
	  this to different values can be seen as roughly a parameter
	  to say how many vowels for a given language.

	  \TODO, the mapping of the [0,1] interval to f1 and f2 values
	  was done by hand by fitting linear (piecewise in the case of
	  f1) functions.  In the future, it would be cool to have the
	  interpolation of values between vowels to be done
	  automatically.  The interpolation of formant values between
	  vowels could be done with some of the clam tools.  Also,
	  this can be seen as a dimension reduction problem, where the
	  f1 and f2 space is reduced to a single dimension.
