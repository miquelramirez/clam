This is a simple Max/MSP patch that converts mouse movements into an OSC control stream. It is meant to be used together with the example CLAM network in the parent directory to show how the OSC plugin works.

To use this patch, you'll need the Max/MSP runtime. It's free. So, if you
don't have it already, go get it for Windows or Mac OS-X at:

Oh yeah... You'll also need the OSC Max object. You can download that at

Put it in the folder /Applications/MaxMSPX.X/Cycling '74/externals
