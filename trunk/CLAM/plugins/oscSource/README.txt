This directory contains an OSC receiver plugin which can be configured to receive an arbitrary number of float messages sent to some target name. 

Load the example clamnetwork in the NetworkEditor to get a better idea of how to use it.

At the moment the OSC receiver is configured to receive messages on the port 7000. (This is commonly used by OSC clients as the default port.)
