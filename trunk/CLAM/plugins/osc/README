This directory contains an OSC receiver plugin which can be
configured to receive an arbitrary number of float messages sent 
to some target name. 

Load the example clamnetwork in the NetworkEditor to get a better 
idea of how to use it.

At the moment the OSC receiver is configured to receive messages 
on the port 7000. (This is commonly used by OSC clients as the 
default port.)


Optionally you can use the 0.26 version with multicast :
  wget http://puzzle.dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/liblo/liblo-0.26.tar.gz
  tar xvzf liblo-0.26.tar.gz && (cd liblo-0.26/ && ./configure && make && sudo make install)

about OSC and linux 64 bits:
using this version
http://www.audiomulch.com/~rossb/code/oscpack/oscpack_1_0_2.zip
edit Makefile adding -fPIC to COPTS:
COPTS  = -Wall -O3 -fPIC

IMPORTANT (rev. 13148): MultiLibloSource class removed, and MultiLibloSourceTyped -> MultiLibloSource. 
The networks using it was updated, but if you have a network using one of them, just run 
CLAM/scripts/clamrefactor.py -x -f CLAM/plugins/osc/migrationScript networktochange.clamnetwork
