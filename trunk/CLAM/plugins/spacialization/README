This is a CLAM plugin which contains some processings to do 3D acoustics simulation.
That means simulating moving sound emitters and receptor within a virtual 3D scenario.
It works by having a database of impulse responses (pressure and velocities) for
each receiver and emitter position within a discrete position grid.

Of course you can reuse the building blocks for simpler or more complex systems:
- Simpler spectral processing (FFT, IFFT, arithmetic operation and conversions)
- Processing of impulse response representation in DFT (computation, interpolation, DB's)
- Low latency real-time convolution
- Processings to map receiver acoustic magnitudes to a surround system.
