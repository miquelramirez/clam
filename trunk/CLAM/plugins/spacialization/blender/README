Blender python scripts to use with CLAM.

Files:
	- BlenderOSCSender.py: to call in FrameChanged Blender events. Sends the
	    positions of objects whithin 'AudioSources' and 'AudioSinks' groups,
	    using the Stefan Kersten OSC python client 
	    (CLAM/plugins/osc/oscpython/OSC.py, searched on '~/src/liblo') using
	    a very basic SpatDIF 3D audio scene description.
 	- network_scene_exporter.py: to call once on a Blender scene. Generates
	    a CLAM network with the propers OSC receivers (MultiLibloSources) 
	    for objects involved in BlenderOSCSender.
	- choreofile_exporter.py: to call once after selecting one source and
	    one sink of the actual scene. Makes a ChoreoSequencer readable file
	- choreofile_exporter_with_network.py: as the previous, but also exports
	    a network with a configured ChoreoSequencer with the proper FPS

Comming soon:
	- BlenderChoreoExporter.py: a Blender scene exporter to ChoreoSequencer
	    processing input files
	- Blender examples, and CLAM networks examples
