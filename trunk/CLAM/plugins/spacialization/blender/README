Blender python scripts to use with CLAM.

Files:

- scene_maker.py: START HERE. To call once. Generates a new Blender
   scene with audio sources and sinks spheres, compatibles with the rest
   of the scripts. You could call: 'blender -P scene_maker.py' from this
   directory. If you include the OSCSenderFilename definition, you will
   need to copy OSC.py on the proper path (see next script).
   
- BlenderOSCSender.py: to call in FrameChanged Blender events, defined
   as OSCSenderFilename in previous script. Sends the positions of 
   objects whithin 'AudioSources' and 'AudioSinks' groups, using the 
   Stefan Kersten OSC python client [1] using a very basic SpatDIF 3D 
   audio scene description (plus a non-standard 'sync/FrameChanged'
   event, with the number of frame).

  [1] CLAM/plugins/osc/oscpython/OSC.py, searched on relative path
       '../../osc/oscpython/OSC.py'

- demo_scene_maker.py: call scene_maker and then assign single circular 
   trajectories on sources objects

- network_scene_exporter.py: to call once on a Blender scene. Generates
   a CLAM network with the propers OSC receivers (MultiLibloSources) 
   for objects involved in BlenderOSCSender.

- choreofile_exporter.py: to call once after selecting one source and
   one sink of the actual scene. Makes a ChoreoSequencer readable file
   and also exports a network with a configured ChoreoSequencer with 
   the proper FPS
