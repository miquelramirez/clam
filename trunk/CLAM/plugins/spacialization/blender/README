Blender python scripts to use with CLAM.

Files:

- BlenderOSCSender.py: to call in FrameChanged Blender events. Sends the
   positions of objects whithin 'AudioSources' and 'AudioSinks' groups,
   using the Stefan Kersten OSC python client [1] using a very basic 
   SpatDIF 3D audio scene description.

  [1] CLAM/plugins/osc/oscpython/OSC.py, searched on '$home/src/liblo'

- network_scene_exporter.py: to call once on a Blender scene. Generates
   a CLAM network with the propers OSC receivers (MultiLibloSources) 
   for objects involved in BlenderOSCSender.

- choreofile_exporter.py: to call once after selecting one source and
   one sink of the actual scene. Makes a ChoreoSequencer readable file

- choreofile_exporter_with_network.py: as the previous, but also exports
   a network with a configured ChoreoSequencer with the proper FPS

- scene_maker.py: to call once. Generates a new Blender scene with audio
   sources and sinks spheres, compatibles with the previous scripts
