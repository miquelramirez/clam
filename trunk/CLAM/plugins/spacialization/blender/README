Here are the blender exporters to use with clam.

Files:
	- BlenderOSCSender.py: script to call in FrameChanged Blender events, which uses the OSC client of CLAM/plugins/osc/oscpython using a very basic SpatDIF 3D audio scene description

Comming soon:
	- BlenderChoreoExporter.py: a Blender scene exporter to ChoreoSequencer processing input files
	- Blender examples, and CLAM networks examples
