/**
 [Deprecated] This Processing crossfades a pair of buffers at each frame.
 Every execution it does a crossfading by ramping and adding both
 input buffers. Every execution the crossfade is done so you can
 control the delay by feeding each port with the same audio source
 but on the crossfading period.
 
 It was intended to solve the problem of realtime switching
 audio buffers convoluted with different impulse responses.

 @deprecated This processing doesn't work as intended when
 	the buffers require overlap on later stages.
 @see XFadeAndSwitch
 @param[in] FadingIn [Port] The audio that fades in
 @param[in] FadingOut [Port] The audio fades out
 @param[out] CrossFadedBuffer [Port] The crossfaded audio buffer
