/**
 This processing provides two delay lines from a IR stream
 so that it is compatible with CLAM::XFadeAndSwitch.
 That is, when the IR changes, it keeps it on one of the
 delay lines for two frames. The lines that it is delayed
 is alternated each change starting with the first one.
 Any successive IR change is retained until the 2 frames
 delay of the last change is applied.

Alternating the delayed output:
@code
i:  AAABBBCCC
o1: AAAAABCCC
o2: AAABBBBBC
    AAAAbBBcC
@endcode
The faster change that can be followed, two frames
@code
i:  AAABBCCC
o1: AAAAACCC
o2: AAABBBBC
    AAAAbBcC
@endcode
Deferred change of C because it was too short same output as above:
@code
i:  AAABCCCC
o1: AAAAACCC
o2: AAABBBBC
    AAAAbBcC
@endcode
In this case C is not even outputed
@code
i:  AAABCDDD
o1: AAAAADDD
o2: AAABBBBD
    AAAAbBdD
