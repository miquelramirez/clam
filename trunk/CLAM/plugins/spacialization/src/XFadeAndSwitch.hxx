/**
 Enable the convolution with an impulse response that changes 
 along the time, avoiding clicks on the change by properly crossfading
 when an impulse response is detected.

 It address two problems, the one is the progressive transition
 over signals, and the other is the mix of signals on some frames
 due to the overlap and add.
 This processing requires the setting of two convolution lines
 which are fed as indicated bellow to discard such crapped frames,
 do the crossfading when the signal is stable and switch to the new
 signal afterwards.

 To understand the process see the following sample sequence:
 Being A,B,C,D different signals
 Being A0 the 0th audio frame of the A signal coming from the iFFT, 
 having double the framesize.
 Being a0 and a0' the two semibuffers of A0 having the frame size
 which are added a0 at frame 0 and a0' at frame 1 during the overlap&add.

 This impose several conditions to the feeder:
 - On a signal change one of the lines should keep the old signal during 2 frames
 - The first line to keep the old signal is 1 and then they alternate.
 - Any other signal change during such 2 frames should be ignored (see D in the example)
