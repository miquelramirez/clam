== Dependencies ==

This is a CLAM plugin so it depends on CLAM (http://clam-project.org)
It also depends on fftw3 and sndfile which are also CLAM dependencies.

The 'raytracing' dependency is a non-released library and it is disabled 
by default. If you develop a library with the same API you can just
enable the option.

== Installing ==

In order to build this plugin you need to compile the inner project 'spectral'.
Provided that you defined CLAM_PREFIX to the prefix you installed clam into,
you can follow this process: 

	cd spectral
	scons prefix=$CLAM_PREFIX
	scons install # sudo if you need to
	cd ..
	PKG_CONFIG_PATH=$CLAM_PREFIX/lib/pkgconfig scons clam_prefix=$CLAM_PREFIX
	PKG_CONFIG_PATH=$CLAM_PREFIX/lib/pkgconfig scons install # sudo if you need to
