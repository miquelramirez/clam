== Dependencies ==

This is a CLAM plugin so it depends on CLAM [1]. It also depends 
on fftw3 [2] and sndfile [3] which are also CLAM dependencies so 
if you compiled CLAM from sources, you might have them installed 
already.
	[1] http://clam-project.org]
	[2] http://www.fftw.org/
	[3] http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/
	
The 'raytracing' dependency is a non-released library and it is
disabled by default. If you develop a library with the same API you
can just enable the option.

== Installing ==

In order to build this plugin you need to compile the inner project
'spectral'. Provided that you defined CLAM_PREFIX to the prefix you
installed clam into, you can follow this process: 

	cd spectral
	scons prefix=$CLAM_PREFIX
	scons install # sudo if you need to
	cd ..
	PKG_CONFIG_PATH=$CLAM_PREFIX/lib/pkgconfig scons clam_prefix=$CLAM_PREFIX
	PKG_CONFIG_PATH=$CLAM_PREFIX/lib/pkgconfig scons install # sudo if you need to
