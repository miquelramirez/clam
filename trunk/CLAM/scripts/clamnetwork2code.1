.SH NAME
clamnetwork2code \- Generates C++ to build a CLAM network
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B clamnetwork2code
\fInetworkFile \fR[\fIclassNameSuffix\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
This script takes a CLAM network xml file and generates C++ code to build such
a network. The resulting network should be equivalent to load the xml with
CLAM storage methods.  The generated code defines a class named
CLAM::NetworkDefinition_<suffix> where suffix is either the second parameter
classNameSuffix or the basename of the networkfile if the suffix is not
provided. Such class has a method called setUp that fills a network with the
proper processings, description, connections and so on.

Bear in mind the following limitations: \- Text items are not implemented \-
Just configurations with simple objects are supported (no subelements, no
attributes). \- Processing names may colide when having non alpha numeric chars
in the same positions. \- Spaces are stripped by sax (there might be a problem
when parsing xmlentities surrounded by spaces).
