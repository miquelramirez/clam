.SH NAME
clam_lv2_generator \- Generates files for CLAM based LV2 plugins
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B clam_lv2_generator
[\fIoptions\fR] \fInetwork1 network2\fR...
.SH DESCRIPTION
This script generates different files needed to build LV2 plugin bundles based
on the information provided by a set of CLAM networks. The script can be used
in three modes: 'manifest' to generate the main metadata index for the bundle,
\&'ttls' to generate a set of ttl's for each plugin in the buncle, and, 'main'
to generate the main source file of the library. If you are using SCons, clam
provides builders to generate all those files. See the LV2 clam example for
more information on how to use it.
