This directory contains code examples for the CLAM framework.
Once installed CLAM, you can compile them with:
 $ scons clam_prefix=/usr
Change /usr to the path CLAM is installed on.

Beside the ones needed to compile CLAM you will need a number 
of extra libraries available such as:
* aubio (http://aubio.org)
