Options:

Retrieve the Processing/Control information from the name.
For each control on the Network we should search a
given childen widget.

Add special properties to the widgets.
:-) Nice, allows a lot of information to be given.
:-( Implies rewrite any widgets you work with.

Provide special invisible widgets with slots that can be 
related to the network and connected to the widgets.
:-( Invisible widgets are ugly to see them in the designer.
:-( Too much configuration (names, slots..)
:-) Allows multi-control widgets
